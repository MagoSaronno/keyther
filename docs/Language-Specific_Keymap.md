# Using a language-specific keyboard layout

Selecting a different keyboard layout instead of the default international US in the QMK Configurator is quite simple, even though not immediate.

- Go to the [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/cantor/LAYOUT_split_3x6_3 "The page with the Cantor already selected") and choose a keymap name for the keymap you are going to create;

- Click and open the **Settings** menu in the top-right area of the page;

- Select from the **HOST KEYBOARD LAYOUT** drop-down list your preferred language layout.

Now the *reference keyboard* on the very bottom of the page should show the keyboard layout of your language of choice.  You can now customise your Keyther keyboard layout and add layers to it.

To download the firmware you should first compile the keymap and then download it using the designated button.
