# Ordering guide (e.g. JLCPCB)

To order the PCB from most of PCB manufacturers' websites you will first need to download the latest Gerber file from the [releases page](https://github.com/MagoSaronno/keyther/releases), which are provided already as a .zip archive.

You will then need to upload this archive to your preferred manufacurer's website (or the cheapest one you can find using the previously mentioned [website](https://pcbshopper.com/ "A price comparison website for printed PCBs"))

Once uploaded the only thing you might consider modifying is the colour of both the PCB itself and *silkscreen* (the text and markings on the PCB).  As mentioned previously, you might also want to choose **LeadFree HASL**, *especially if you do not have a fume extractor*.

You can then proceed by adding the order to your cart and filling your payment and shipping details

***Do not forget to double-check the shipping method, because some major websites tend to change them without warning***
