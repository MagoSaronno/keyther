# Keyther assembling guide

1. Prepare all the components and heat up your soldering iron.
   
   > NOTE: It is strongly recommended to flash the firmware to the microcontroller before proceeding to the second step

2. Start by soldering the pin strips to the microcontroller, helping yourself with the PCB to position the shorter pins side as perpendicular to the microcontroller as possible.

3. Place the PCB with the **bottom side** facing up and solder all the hot-swap sockets this way: 
   
    - tin one of the two PCB pads with a moderate amount of solder;
   
    - place the socket in the correct position;
   
    - place the soldering iron tip inside the socket contact above the tinned pad and press down until the socket is properly soldered to the pad;
   
    - solder the other socket contact.

4- Place the microcontroller underneath the PCB, solder it to the board and trim the pins.

5- Place the RJ45 socket underneath the PCB in the correct holes and solder it to the board.

6- Insert the switches in their sockets and add the keycaps.

7- Enjoy your Keyther!
